## When to use this skill

- **Before writing any code** — expose hidden assumptions with Socratic interviewing (Ambiguity ≤ 0.2 required)
- **Vague requirements** — crystallize into an immutable YAML seed spec before touching the keyboard
- **Long-running tasks** needing autonomous iteration until verified completion
- **Guaranteed completion tasks** — Ralph loop persists across session boundaries until verification passes
- **When stuck** — Nine Minds lateral thinking personas break through stagnation
- **Drift detection** — measure deviation from original seed and course-correct before it's too late
- **Ontology convergence** — evolutionary loop runs until consecutive generations are ≥ 0.95 similar

## Quick Start

```text
ooo interview "design a Unity quest system with testable save-state behavior"
ooo seed
ooo ralph "implement the accepted Unity quest system and verify playmode tests"
```

---

## Instructions

1. Use `ooo interview` first when the Unity task is vague or spans gameplay, tooling, and verification.
2. Freeze the clarified contract with `ooo seed` before long-running execution.
3. Run `ooo ralph` only after acceptance criteria and verification targets are explicit.

## Examples

```text
ooo interview "add a Unity inventory system without breaking save compatibility"
```

```text
ooo ralph "fix all failing editmode tests in the combat package"
```

---

## Core Architecture: The Ouroboros Loop

```
    Interview → Seed → Execute → Evaluate
        ↑                           ↓
        └──── Evolutionary Loop ────┘
```

Each cycle **evolves**, not repeats. Evaluation output feeds back as input for the next generation until the system converges.

### Double Diamond

```
    ◇ Wonder          ◇ Design
   ╱  (diverge)      ╱  (diverge)
  ╱    explore      ╱    create
 ╱                 ╱
◆ ──────────── ◆ ──────────── ◆
 ╲                 ╲
  ╲    define       ╲    deliver
   ╲  (converge)     ╲  (converge)
    ◇ Ontology        ◇ Evaluation
```

**First diamond (Socratic):** diverge into questions → converge into ontological clarity.
**Second diamond (Pragmatic):** diverge into design options → converge into verified delivery.

You cannot design what you haven't understood. The first diamond is a prerequisite for the second.

## Phase 1: Interview — From Wonder to Ontology

> *Wonder → "How should I live?" → "What IS 'live'?" → Ontology* — Socrates

The Socratic Interviewer asks questions until **Ambiguity ≤ 0.2**. This is the gate between vague desire and executable spec.

```
ooo interview "I want to build a task management CLI"
```

### Ambiguity Formula

```
Ambiguity = 1 − Σ(clarityᵢ × weightᵢ)

Greenfield: Goal(40%) + Constraint(30%) + Success(30%)
Brownfield: Goal(35%) + Constraint(25%) + Success(25%) + Context(15%)

Threshold: Ambiguity ≤ 0.2 → ready for Seed
```

**Example scoring:**
```
Goal:       0.9 × 0.4 = 0.36   # "Build a CLI task manager" — clear
Constraint: 0.8 × 0.3 = 0.24   # "Python 3.14+, SQLite only" — defined
Success:    0.7 × 0.3 = 0.21   # "Tasks create/list/complete" — measurable
                      ──────
Clarity             = 0.81
Ambiguity = 1 − 0.81 = 0.19 ≤ 0.2 → ✓ Ready for Seed
```

Why 0.2? At 80% weighted clarity, remaining unknowns are small enough for code-level decisions to resolve. Above that threshold, you're still guessing at architecture.

---

## Phase 2: Seed — Immutable Specification

```
ooo seed
```

Generates YAML spec locked from interview answers:

```yaml
goal: Build a CLI task management tool
constraints:
  - Python 3.14+
  - No external database
  - SQLite for persistence
acceptance_criteria:
  - Tasks can be created with title and priority
  - Tasks can be listed with status filter
  - Tasks can be marked complete
ontology_schema:
  name: TaskManager
  fields:
    - name: tasks
      type: array
    - name: title
      type: string
    - name: priority
      type: enum[low, medium, high]
    - name: status
      type: enum[open, done]
```

**The seed is immutable.** Once generated, it is the ground truth. Drift is measured against it.

---

## Phase 3: Execute — Double Diamond Run

```
ooo run seed.yaml
ooo run   # uses seed from conversation context
```

Executes the four phases:
1. **Discover** — research existing patterns, constraints, precedents
2. **Define** — ontological clarity, edge cases, decision boundaries
3. **Design** — architecture, component breakdown, interface contracts
4. **Deliver** — implementation, tests, documentation

---

## Phase 4: Evaluate — 3-Stage Verification Gate

```
ooo evaluate <session_id>
```

| Stage | Cost | What It Checks |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Mechanical** | Free | Lint, build, tests, coverage, type checks |
| **Semantic** | Standard | AC compliance, goal alignment, drift score |
| **Consensus** | Frontier (optional) | Multi-model vote, majority ratio |

### Drift Thresholds

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `0.0 – 0.15` | Excellent | On track |
| `0.15 – 0.30` | Acceptable | Monitor closely |
| `0.30+` | Exceeded | Course correction required |

Drift = weighted deviation from seed across three axes: Goal(50%) + Constraint(30%) + Ontology(20%).

---

## Phase 5: Evolve — Ontological Convergence

```
ooo evolve "build a task management CLI"
ooo evolve "topic" --no-execute   # ontology-only fast mode
```

### Flow

```
Gen 1: Interview → Seed(O₁) → Execute → Evaluate
Gen 2: Wonder → Reflect → Seed(O₂) → Execute → Evaluate
Gen 3: Wonder → Reflect → Seed(O₃) → Execute → Evaluate
...until Similarity ≥ 0.95 or 30 generations
```

### Convergence Formula

```
Similarity = 0.5 × name_overlap + 0.3 × type_match + 0.2 × exact_match
Threshold: Similarity ≥ 0.95 → CONVERGED

Gen 1: {Task, Priority, Status}                     → baseline
Gen 2: {Task, Priority, Status, DueDate}            → similarity 0.78 → CONTINUE
Gen 3: {Task, Priority, Status, DueDate}            → similarity 1.00 → CONVERGED ✓
```

### Stagnation Detection

| Signal | Condition | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Stagnation** | Similarity ≥ 0.95 for 3 consecutive gens | Stop — converged |
| **Oscillation** | Gen N ≈ Gen N-2 (period-2 cycle) | Invoke `contrarian` persona |
| **Repetitive feedback** | ≥ 70% question overlap across 3 gens | Invoke `researcher` persona |
| **Hard cap** | 30 generations reached | Stop — safety valve |

## Ralph — Persistent Loop Until Verified

```
ooo ralph "fix all failing tests"
ooo ralph "implement the payment module"
```

**"The boulder never stops."**
Each failure is data for the next attempt. Only verified success or max iterations stops it.

### Loop Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. EXECUTE (parallel agents)       │
│     Fire independent sub-tasks      │
│     concurrently via Agent tool     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. VERIFY                          │
│     Check acceptance criteria       │
│     Run tests, lint, typecheck      │
│     Measure drift vs seed           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. LOOP (if failed)                │
│     Analyze failure evidence        │
│     Fix identified issues           │
│     Increment iteration counter     │
│     Repeat from step 1              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. PERSIST (each iteration)        │
│     .omc/state/ralph-ooo-state.json │
│     Resume after interruption       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### State File Schema

Create `.omc/state/ralph-ooo-state.json` on start:

```json
{
  "mode": "ralph-ooo",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "request": "<user request>",
  "status": "running",
  "iteration": 0,
  "max_iterations": 10,
  "last_checkpoint": null,
  "seed_path": null,
  "verification_history": []
}
```

### Loop Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
while iteration < max_iterations:
    result = execute_parallel(request, context)
    verification = verify_result(result, acceptance_criteria)
    state.verification_history.append({
        "iteration": iteration,
        "passed": verification.passed,
        "score": verification.score,
        "timestamp": now()
    })
    save_checkpoint(f"iteration_{iteration}")
    if verification.passed:
        save_checkpoint("complete")
        break
    iteration += 1
```

### Progress Report Format

```
[Ralph-OOO Iteration 1/10]
Executing in parallel...

Verification: FAILED
Score: 0.65
Issues:
  - 3 tests still failing
  - Type error in src/api.py:42

The boulder never stops. Continuing...

[Ralph-OOO Iteration 3/10]
Verification: PASSED ✓
Score: 1.0

Ralph-OOO COMPLETE
==================
Request: Fix all failing tests
Duration: 8m 32s
Iterations: 3
Verification History:
  - Iteration 1: FAILED (0.65)
  - Iteration 2: FAILED (0.85)
  - Iteration 3: PASSED (1.0)
```

### Completion Promise (Codex / Gemini)

```xml
<promise>DONE</promise>
```

Default promise: `DONE` | Default max iterations: `10`

### Cancellation

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Save checkpoint & exit | `/ouroboros:cancel` or `/ralph-ooo:cancel` |
| Force clear all state | `/ouroboros:cancel --force` |
| Resume after interruption | `ooo ralph continue` |

## The Nine Minds

Loaded on-demand — never preloaded. Each mind has a single core question it cannot stop asking.

| Agent | Role | Core Question |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Socratic Interviewer** | Questions-only. Never builds. | *"What are you assuming?"* |
| **Ontologist** | Finds essence, not symptoms | *"What IS this, really?"* |
| **Seed Architect** | Crystallizes specs from dialogue | *"Is this complete and unambiguous?"* |
| **Evaluator** | 3-stage verification | *"Did we build the right thing?"* |
| **Contrarian** | Challenges every assumption | *"What if the opposite were true?"* |
| **Hacker** | Finds unconventional paths | *"What constraints are actually real?"* |
| **Simplifier** | Removes complexity | *"What's the simplest thing that could work?"* |
| **Researcher** | Stops coding, starts investigating | *"What evidence do we actually have?"* |
| **Architect** | Identifies structural causes | *"If we started over, would we build it this way?"* |

## Unstuck — Lateral Thinking

When blocked after repeated failures:

```
ooo unstuck                  # auto-select based on context
ooo unstuck simplifier       # cut scope to MVP
ooo unstuck hacker           # make it work first, elegance later
ooo unstuck contrarian       # challenge all assumptions
ooo unstuck researcher       # stop coding, find missing information
ooo unstuck architect        # restructure the approach entirely
```

**Decision guide:**
- Repeated similar failures → `contrarian` (challenge assumptions)
- Too many options / paralysis → `simplifier` (reduce scope)
- Missing information / unclear root cause → `researcher` (seek evidence)
- Analysis paralysis / need momentum → `hacker` (just make it work)
- Structural issues / wrong foundation → `architect` (redesign)
